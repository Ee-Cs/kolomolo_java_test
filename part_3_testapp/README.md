# Kolomolo Java test - Part 3

## Micro Data Warehouse with Docker, Spring boot, Spark and Hadoop

You will be required to approach a completely new problem, that you likely did not have the opportunity to work with before.
Your task is to understand the requirements of the project and follow up by learning and applying new skills.

The software - HADOOP, Spark and Docker - are not part of the job, but those tools and skills are very demanded on the market
and sooner or later you will have to deal with them. You will be tasked to build a small project that combines a set of skill
to achieve a specific result.

Please, provide us with the code solution for the requirements listed below:

- Create a docker compose that runs SPARK and HADOOP toy data warehouse
- upload the provided [dataset](https://github.com/alexkolomolo/javatest/blob/main/data/foodhub_order.csv) to Hadoop remote filesystem
- build small __Spark__ application to generate a result from the dataset: 10 Top cuisine types along with the number of restaurants serving them
- build java springboot application to execute this __spark application__ and get the result in your springboot application
- as a bonus you may use some javascript to display the results

### Submission rules

You should submit the code into your cloned repository and either give us access and share it with us or zip the repository and share
the project via email. Take the time to learn the new technology and solve the problem.

# Kolomolo Java test

The test is divided in 3 sections
- Technical aptitude test
- Java Skills test project
- New Skills project

Creativity and extra scenarios will greatly improve the evaluation

## General aptitude test

1. Can you tell me what annoys you in Java SpringBoot the most? What features would you like to have in Java SpringBoot that you don't have now?
1. How would you go about creating a Java service on the cloud? Specify steps and explain why.
1. Do you know any other ways of configuring Java SprintBoot apps but the application context file? Why would you use them? What are the benefits?
1. Did you work with any enterprise solutions and if yes - tell me more about this experience?
1. Explain your process for debugging errors in your Java code.
   -  What debugging techniques do you find most effective?
   - How do you approach identifying the root cause of an error?
   - Do you have any preferred tools or strategies for debugging complex issues?
1. How do you write clean and maintainable Java code?
   - What coding conventions or best practices do you follow?
   - How do you document your code for better understanding by others?
   - Describe your strategies for ensuring code readability and maintainability over time.
1. . Explain your approach to testing your Java code.
   - What types of tests do you typically write (e.g., unit tests, integration tests)?
   - How do you ensure your tests cover various functionalities and edge cases?
   - Do you utilize any testing frameworks or tools?
1. Describe a situation where you got stuck on a Java problem. How did you approach it?
   - What troubleshooting steps did you take?
   - Did you seek help from others, or what resources did you utilize?
   - How did this experience influence your problem-solving approach?
1. Describe a scenario where you implemented a design pattern in a Java project. Which pattern did you use, and why was it the most suitable choice?
   - Explain the problem you were trying to solve.
   - Discuss the benefits of using the chosen design pattern in that specific context.
   - How did the design pattern improve the code structure, maintainability, or other aspects of the project?
1. What experience do you have with AWS?

## Java Skills test project

Follow the steps outlined below to copy the repository and 
start working on the project  (WIP)
```
1. clone this repository
2. xxxx
3. zzzz
```

## New Skills project

You will be required to approach a completely new problem, that you likely did not have the opportunity to work with before.
Your task is to understand the requirements of the project and follow up by learning and applying new skills.

The software - HADOOP, Spark and Docker - are not part of the job, but those tools and skills are very demanded on the market
and sooner or later you will have to deal with them. You will be tasked to build a small project that combines a set of skill
to achieve a specific result.

Please, provide us with the code solution for the requirements listed below:

- Create a docker compose that runs SPARK and HADOOP toy data warehouse
- upload the provided [dataset](https://github.com/alexkolomolo/javatest/blob/main/data/foodhub_order.csv) to Hadoop remote filesystem
- build small __Spark__ application to generate a result from the dataset: 10 Top cuisine types along with the number of restaurants serving them
- build java springboot application to execute this __spark application__ and get the result in your springboot application
- as a bonus you may use some javascript to display the results

### Submission rules

You should submit the code into your cloned repository and either give us access and share it with us or zip the repository and share
the project via email. Take the time to learn the new technology and solve the problem.

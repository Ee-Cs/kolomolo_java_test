Please, provide us with the code solution for the steps listed below:

- Create a docker compose that launches SPARK and HADOOP
- Upload a dataset file that we give you to HADOOP
- Using Java SpringBoot execute SPARK application, execute the application you’ve created in SPARK that processes the dataset we gave you.

The dataset processing is going to do the following:

- Analyze the dataset and give us the list of 10 most profitable types of food ordered by the customers from this dataset.
